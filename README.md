# MDN LINK HERE FOR BALL BOUNCING IN VANILLA

#### Overview

Big Happy Dog game was inspired by a weekend watch of airbud with my 3 year old daughter. I used to love that movie, and it turns out it was really bad this whole time. That's beside the point. 
The echanics of this game most closely relate to pong.
A basketball will fall from the top of one's screen(canvas) and will maintain a constant bounce on all sides of the screen aslong as it is continuously sent back up by the dog.

The dogs face is initially sad - but will slowly morph into a happy one as you reach ten constant bounces.

You can go past ten to set a personal highscore (gone after reload of site)
but the winner is announced after ten bounces - as the dog has reached peak happiness.

#### Tech and Tech Problems


- I expect to use HTML/CSS/Javascript for this project - and dont expect having to use any specific libraries. Pong can be made in vanilla javascript.

- One of the most challenging things to me so far will be figuring out how to include a ball within a canvas that takes the canvas' coordinates and corresponds. I have only done this ball bounce method before on a full window scale.

- Keeping score. I'd imagine that one could add one digit to someVariable as the ball's circumfrence collides with the 'dogHead'.

- NEEDS to research whether or not I can use flex box to set up my website's layout and keeo a game inside of a canvas. (currently unsure why it owuld be an issue but would like to make sure. I know flex box sets it's own axis.)

#### BONUS

- would like to add sound effects.
('ball bouncing on wall', 'dog bark', 'sad dog', 'happy dog', etc..)

- would like to add a 'share screen shot on facebook' option that atutomatically snaps a screen shot and brings them to a facebook share page with it ready to be attached. 

- I would like to add a 'layered' 3d esque background to the canvas to put the dog in an inner-city. (This would be a seperate branch and would most likely include 1 or more added libraries to add 'cameras'. If done - I will document.)



#### Starter Code

NOTHIN YET :D

#### Get Started

- Wire Frame DONE

- HTML/CSS layout with Flex Box to model Wire Frame.

- Get a ball bouncing on all sides of the canvas.

- Add a 'dogHead' (really just a ball with a some dog.jpg coated on top.) and make it interactive with the ball.

- Make the dog moveable to the width of the canvas via arrow keys.

-Keep score of any time the dog hits the ball - reset the score and class(es) of 'dogHead' if the ball reaches the floor of the canvas (someNum x,someNum y).

- Alternatively - before reset and once the ball has touched the ground - end the game and ask to play again.

(EXPECTED TO BE EDITED GREATLY)
